discuss different embedded architecture and justify why ARM is best
choice. Memory and other component requirements etc.
\section {Software Evaluation}
discuss about different options like bare code without any OS, other
open source OS and finally Linux. Justify uses of Linux.
\section {Component of embedded Linux software}
\subsection {Toolchain}
cross toolchain, why and how

why and how, if not then other alternatives.
\subsection {First level boot loader}
ddr initialization code, why and how
\subsection {Second level boot loader}

preparation of Linux booting. Minimal Linux component needed
(menuconfig) for our implementation. Also discuss about V4L2 camera
framework.
