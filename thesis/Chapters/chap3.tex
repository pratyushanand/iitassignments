\label{Chapter3}
We have done evaluation of embedded solution of our implementation on
the basis of following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Low cost:} It is very important for any mass
		market product.
	\item \textbf{Low power:} Reducing energy consumption is a
		movement and is necessary for a greener world.
		Technically also it is very important for a prolonged
		battery life.
	\item \textbf{Rapid software development:} Today lot of software
		is available in every domain of science by open source
		community. Platform must be developed by considering
		re-usability of available software in public domain.
\end{itemize}
\section {Hardware Evaluation}
discuss different embedded architecture and justify why ARM is best
choice. Memory and other component requirements etc.
\section {Software Evaluation}
discuss about different options like bare code without any OS, other
open source OS and finally Linux. Justify uses of Linux.
\section {Component of embedded Linux software}
\subsection {Toolchain}
cross toolchain, why and how
\subsection {BootROM}
why and how, if not then other alternatives.
\subsection {First level boot loader}
ddr initialization code, why and how
\subsection {Second level boot loader}
preparation of OS booting, why and how
\subsection {Second level boot }
preparation of OS booting, why and how
\subsection {Operation System}
preparation of Linux booting. Minimal Linux component needed
(menuconfig) for our implementation. Also discuss about V4L2 camera
framework.
\subsection {Root filesystem}
RFS, what, why and how
