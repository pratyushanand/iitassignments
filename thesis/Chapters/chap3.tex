We observe that with our implementation, code is able to detect a moving
person after it's 3 steps move. Figure  \ref{pipeline_images} shows
output images at different stages of pipeline.

We have also done experiments with negative images like a person moving
on bicycle, or a vehicle moving on road. Our algorithm is successfully
able to reject these objects. Figure \ref{negative_inputs} shows that
how does this implementation rejects moving vehicle and bicycle and  does
not recognize them as human.

Comparison of proposed framework with HAAR and IDIAP detection algorithm
in figure \ref{pipeline_execution_time} shows that, this is quite
faster. Our pipeline takes just 3.6 mS on the average, while HARR and
IDIAP takes around 20mS and 248 mS respectively per frame. This timing
was observed with a system having DMIPS = 800.

So if a surveillance application requires to identify moving person,
then we might not need to use complex algorithm. Processor like Coretx
M3/M4 are used in an embedded environment with a low power application.
Such processors have DMIPS of 1.25 dmips/Mhz. If we use such processors
at 300 MHz, our pipeline will be able to process one frame in less than
8 mS, and therefore system can go in sleep mode for longer time and
hence can save a lot of powers.
