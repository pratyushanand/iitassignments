Future work may be carried in following directions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Test of this algorithm with real camera connected and Zigbee
network will provide good confidence to use it.
\item A research work may be initiated to see actual power saving using
such a low complexity pipeline.
\item There can be improvement in blob tracking algorithm to predict
next position on the basis of past N number of frames.
\item We have seen that low end micro-controller is not able to work with
single frame human detection algorithms. These algorithm can either run on
high performance CPU, or GPU. A work can be initiated to implement such
algorithms in hardware and then to use this hardware with low end
micro-controller. It would be interesting to see difference between power
consumption of two systems.
\item 
\end{enumerate}
