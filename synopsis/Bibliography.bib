  abstract = {In this paper, we present a fast method to detect humans from videos
	captured in surveillance applications. It is based on a cascade of
	LogitBoost classifiers relying on features mapped from the Riemanian
	manifold of region covariance matrices computed from input image
	features. The method was extended in several ways. First, as the
	mapping process is slow for high dimensional feature space, we propose
	to select weak classifiers based on subsets of the complete image
	feature space. In addition, we propose to combine these sub-matrix
	covariance features with the means of the image features computed
	within the same subwindow, which are readily available from the covariance
	extraction process. Finally, in the context of video acquired with
	stationary cameras, we propose to fuse image features from the spatial
	and temporal domains in order to jointly learn the correlation between
	appearance and foreground information based on background subtraction.
	Our method evaluated on a large set of videos coming from several
	databases (CAVIAR, PETS, ...,',','),
	
	and can process from 5 to 20 frames/sec (for a 384x288 video) while
	achieving similar or better performance than existing methods.},

  abstract = {{This paper presents a technique for motion detection that incorporates
	several innovative mechanisms. For example, our proposed technique
	stores, for each pixel, a set of values taken in the past at the
	same location or in the neighborhood. It then compares this set to
	the current pixel value in order to determine whether that pixel
	belongs to the background, and adapts the model by choosing randomly
	which values to substitute from the background model. This approach
	differs from those based upon the classical belief that the oldest
	values should be replaced first. Finally, when the pixel is found
	to be part of the background, its value is propagated into the background
	model of a neighboring pixel. We describe our method in full details
	(including pseudo-code and the parameter values used) and compare
	it to other background subtraction techniques. Efficiency figures
	show that our method outperforms recent and proven state-of-the-art
	methods in terms of both computation speed and detection rate. We
	also analyze the performance of a downscaled version of our algorithm
	to the absolute minimum of one comparison and one byte of memory
	per pixel. It appears that even such a simplified version of our
	algorithm performs better than mainstream techniques.}},

	in urban scenes, 2) we propose a refined per-frame evaluation methodology

	and 3) we evaluate the performance of sixteen pretrained state-of-the-art
	detectors across six data sets. Our study allows us to assess the
	state of the art and provides a framework for gauging future efforts.

	on the platform, background subtraction and update techniques are
	used. In addition, due to the high variation of brightness on the

	of background pixels. A multi-layer feed forward neural network was
