First part of program is to compute fundamental matrix and then to
draw corresponding eplines.
it also claculate world co-ordinate considering image's left corner
as the world coordinate system's origin.


for help type
#./fundamental -h

to run the code
#./fundamental -f left.jpg -s right.jpg -n 7


Second part of program is to calibrate camera parameters.
to run that code
#./calibrate
